> Class, Objective and Method
---

Class is like a tool that generates a certain type of objects.
Depending on the class, different types of objectives can be made.
For example, here `int` is a class which generates "integer" type of object.
`a` is the name of object with the initialized value `5`, which becomes "objective" with integer characteristics. 
```cpp
int a(5);
```

What's good with the definition of class & objective? Unlike unconsciously using this innate class, we can make our own class and frame objectives as we want.

```cpp
class vector(int a, int b){
    vector(int a, int b){
    }

int main(){
    vector a(2, 7);
}
```

If you look at the main function, the way of using `vector` is pretty much the same as using `int`.
Moreover, we can design the class by simply adding some functions.
The function inside the class is called "Method".
