```python

There're a lot of sorting algorithm.
Bubble sort, quick sort, etc.
Then how do we implement them using logic circuits?

Well basically they're done in CPU, which is pretty complicated that's operating general computation.

Which means, that's not precisely for solving sorting problem.
So here's sorting network

Since it's for specified hardward implementation, there're some restriction.
That's what we get for using a specialized logic circuits that's not flexible.

The primary concepts is that fixed input size.
