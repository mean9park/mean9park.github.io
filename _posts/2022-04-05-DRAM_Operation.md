# DRAM Device Configuration

DRAM(Dynamically Random Access Memory) is being most widely used as a main memory.
With a tremendous development of semiconductor industry, the performance(Power, BW, etc) of DRAM wouldn't stop(there's always been people who think the performance is close to an end tho).
How has it been possible to constantly increase the performance?
Well, I guess we first should dive into the details of what DRAM looks like inside and how it operates.

I drew some overall DRAM structure overall here.

Start with the basic (physically smallest) part, DRAM cell.
